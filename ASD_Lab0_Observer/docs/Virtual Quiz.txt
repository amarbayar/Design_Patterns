1) What is the problem?
Note that in several places, there is a tight coupling between the counting (model) logic, and the views (GUI display). This is not good, it violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

2) Describe some specific impacts of this design issue, examples of why it would lead to a poor result.
So you need a better design, that will promote a decoupling and separation (and encapsulation) of each of these two parts of the design. Hint: Observer Pattern.

3)What issues arise from the new derived ObservableCounter which IsA Counter, and also IsA Observable?
